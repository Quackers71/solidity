18. Notes on comments section from a User asking for more up to date solidity version code i.e. 
    With the recent release of solidity version 0.6.0, I think it would be great to see some updates, as it looks like a lot has changed since V0.4.17.

    Response from another User: 

    Given the above stated facts I've been frustrated with attempts to find good, reliable learning material on Ethereum/Solidity/Web3.js on the web (outside of official docs) and to be honest, this course is the most enjoyable and acceptable material I've come across so far. I agree with your point about wanting the lessons to provide more up-to-date code, and so I've decided to help make this a reality via a public GitHub repo I've created at:

    https://github.com/owanhunte/ethereum-solidity-course-updated-code

    Hopefully, this repo helps add additional value to current and future students enrolled in this course and allows you to always have access to code compatible with the latest released versions of Solidity, Web3.js, etc.
